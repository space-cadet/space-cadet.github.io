# Technical Context: Deepak Vaid's Portfolio Website

## Technology Stack

This portfolio website uses a deliberately lightweight technology stack to ensure simplicity, maintainability, and performance:

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom properties, flexbox, and grid
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core functionality without frameworks
- **Font Awesome**: Icon set for visual elements
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Inter and Playfair Display)

### Development Approach
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content works without JavaScript
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Built from small screens up
- **Static Site**: No backend dependencies for simplicity and performance
- **Modular CSS**: Organized by component for maintainability

## Technical Decisions

### Why No Framework?
The decision to avoid JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) was deliberate:
1. **Simplicity**: Portfolio content is largely static and doesn't require complex state management
2. **Performance**: Vanilla JS offers the smallest possible payload
3. **Longevity**: Reduces future maintenance needs from framework updates/changes
4. **Focus**: Emphasizes content and design rather than technical implementation

### Responsive Strategy
The responsive design uses:
1. **CSS Grid** for overall page layout
2. **Flexbox** for component-level layouts
3. **Relative Units** (rem, em, %) for scalability
4. **Media Queries** for breakpoint-specific adjustments
5. **Mobile-First Approach** to ensure proper small-screen experience

### Animation Philosophy
Animations are used sparingly and purposefully:
1. **Physics-Inspired Particles**: Thematically relevant to quantum physics
2. **Subtle Hover Effects**: Enhance interactivity without distraction
3. **Scroll Transitions**: Guide users through content flow
4. **Performance-Conscious**: Utilizing CSS transitions and animations over JS when possible

### Asset Strategy
1. **Icon System**: Font Awesome provides vector icons for resolution independence
2. **Typography**: Google Fonts selected for readability and academic feel
3. **Image Optimization**: Will implement responsive image loading and optimization
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Limited external resources to reduce HTTP requests

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Support
- Targeting modern browsers (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- No explicit support for IE11 or older

### Performance Goals
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse Performance Score > 90
- Total page size < 1MB

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

### Security Considerations
- No form submission or user data collection
- External links properly secured with rel attributes
- Content Security Policy to be implemented

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Current Technical Debt
- JavaScript could benefit from more structured organization
- CSS has some redundancy that could be refactored
- Image optimization not yet fully implemented
- No automated testing in place

### Planned Technical Improvements
1. **JavaScript Modularization**: Break into separate functional files
2. **CSS Custom Properties**: Expand use for theming (dark mode)
3. **Image Pipeline**: Add responsive image processing
4. **Build Process**: Implement simple build for minification and optimization
5. **Service Worker**: Add for offline capability and performance

### Future Technical Possibilities
1. **Static Site Generator**: Potential migration to 11ty or similar for content management
2. **WebGL Visualizations**: For interactive physics demonstrations
3. **JAMstack Approach**: For blog content integration
4. **Web Components**: For fully encapsulated UI elements

## Development Workflow

### Current Workflow
1. Direct file editing in a code editor
2. Manual testing across devices and browsers
3. Git version control with regular commits
4. Manual deployment

### Planned Workflow Improvements
1. Add local development server
2. Implement basic build process
3. Add automated testing
4. Set up continuous integration
5. Automate deployment

### Naming Conventions
- **CSS Classes**: BEM-inspired approach (block__element--modifier)
- **JavaScript**: camelCase for variables and functions
- **Files**: kebab-case for filenames
