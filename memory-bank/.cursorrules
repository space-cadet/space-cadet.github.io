# Project Rules and Guidelines: Deepak Vaid's Portfolio

## Code Structure and Organization

### HTML Patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Maintain logical nesting of elements
- Use `id` attributes for section anchors and JavaScript targets
- Use `class` attributes for styling hooks
- Keep indentation consistent (2 spaces)
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

### CSS Organization
- Follow section-based organization, grouping styles by portfolio section
- Use BEM-inspired naming: `.block__element--modifier`
- Leverage CSS variables for theming and consistency
- Maintain mobile-first approach, adding media queries for larger screens
- Keep related properties grouped (positioning, dimensions, typography, etc.)
- Add comments for complex or non-obvious styling

### JavaScript Patterns
- Use event delegation where appropriate
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use consistent camelCase naming for variables and functions
- Add comments for function purpose and complex logic
- Organize by functionality
- Avoid global variables

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Professional but accessible tone
- Clear, concise descriptions of technical concepts
- First-person voice for personal sections
- Third-person for publications and formal content
- Balance technical terminology with explanations

### Visual Design
- Maintain consistent spacing (multiples of 8px)
- Follow the established color palette
- Use quantum physics-inspired visual elements where appropriate
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Maintain consistent card heights within sections

## Implementation Preferences

### Animation Usage
- Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract
- Keep animations under 300ms for UI responses
- Use physics-based animations for quantum-themed elements
- Ensure animations can be reduced/disabled for users with motion sensitivity

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: Base styles
- Tablet: 768px and above
- Desktop: 1024px and above
- Large Desktop: 1440px and above

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images before adding to the project
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Use CSS transforms/opacity for animations
- Ensure text remains visible during webfont loading

## Modification Workflow

### Adding New Content
1. Identify the appropriate section
2. Follow existing HTML structure patterns
3. Add necessary CSS following section conventions
4. Test responsiveness across breakpoints
5. Update Memory Bank documentation if adding new patterns

### Updating Existing Content
1. Maintain the established structure
2. Preserve class names for consistency
3. Test changes across all viewport sizes
4. Document significant changes in changelog.md

## File Naming Conventions

- HTML files: lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `research-detail.html`)
- CSS files: lowercase, descriptive (e.g., `research-section.css`)
- JS files: camelCase, functional description (e.g., `particleAnimation.js`)
- Images: lowercase, descriptive with dimension suffix (e.g., `profile-photo-800w.jpg`)

## Design Decisions and Preferences

### Typography
- Headings: Playfair Display (serif)
- Body text: Inter (sans-serif)
- Font sizes using relative units (rem)
- Base text size: 16px (1rem)
- Line heights: 1.5-1.6 for body text, 1.2-1.3 for headings

### Color Usage
- Primary color (#2C3E50) for main elements and emphasis
- Secondary color (#3498DB) for interactive elements and accents
- Quantum theme colors for specialized elements
- Light background (#ECF0F1) for alternating sections
- Dark background (#1A252F) for footer and contrast areas

## Project-Specific Knowledge
