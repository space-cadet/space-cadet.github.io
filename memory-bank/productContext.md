# Product Context: Deepak Vaid's Portfolio Website

## Purpose and Vision

This portfolio website serves as a comprehensive digital representation of Dr. Deepak Vaid's professional identity, research contributions, and technical skills. It aims to bridge the worlds of theoretical physics and computer science, presenting Dr. Vaid as both a serious researcher in quantum gravity and a capable programmer/developer.

The vision is to create a digital space that accurately conveys the depth and breadth of Dr. Vaid's expertise while making complex scientific concepts accessible to various audience types. This portfolio will serve as both an academic credential showcase and a platform for knowledge dissemination.

## Problem Statement

High-level researchers in theoretical physics often struggle to effectively communicate their work to:
1. Other academics outside their specific subfield
2. Potential employers or collaborators in related technical fields
3. Students and aspiring researchers
4. The general public interested in advanced physics concepts

Additionally, researchers with programming skills often lack a centralized platform to demonstrate both their academic and technical capabilities together in a cohesive narrative.
