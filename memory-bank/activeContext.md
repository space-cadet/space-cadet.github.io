# Active Context: Deepak Vaid's Portfolio Website

## Current State
The portfolio website has evolved into a mature multi-page structure with recent enhancements:

1. **Multi-page architecture** with main portfolio and dedicated projects showcase:
   - Main site (`index.html`) with comprehensive professional sections
   - Dedicated projects page (`projects/index.html`) featuring software and documentation
   - Enhanced navigation between pages

2. **Enhanced visual design and branding**:
   - Quantum physics-themed SVG favicon and brand assets
   - Improved publication cards with year badges and enhanced styling
   - Enhanced YouTube statistics with gradient backgrounds
   - Optimized section spacing for better mobile experience

3. **Comprehensive technical foundation**:
   - Responsive design elements with refined spacing
   - Quantum-themed animation effects (particle system)
   - Professional color schemes with enhanced visual hierarchy
   - Typography optimized for academic and technical content
   - Fixed JavaScript syntax errors and improved code quality

## Current Focus
With the recent completion of the projects page and visual enhancements, the focus has shifted to:

1. **Refinement and optimization phase**: Fine-tuning the enhanced multi-page structure
2. **Content quality and presentation**: Leveraging the improved styling for better content showcase
3. **Technical polish**: Building on the enhanced foundation with further improvements
4. **User experience optimization**: Ensuring the new multi-page structure provides seamless navigation

## Active Decisions

### Design Philosophy
- Using a clean, academic aesthetic with modern interactive elements
- Color scheme based on blue tones with quantum-inspired accent colors
- Balancing professional credibility with visual interest
- Card-based layout for easy content consumption

### Content Organization
- Hierarchical presentation of content, starting with personal overview
- Segmentation of content into distinct but connected sections
- Strategic use of statistics and metrics to quantify achievements
- Integration of external resources and platforms (GitHub, YouTube, blog)

### Technical Approach
- HTML5 semantic elements for proper structure
- CSS3 for styling with Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity to keep dependencies minimal
- Performance optimization through efficient code

## Next Steps
1. Refine responsive behavior for various screen sizes
2. Implement additional interactive elements for research visualization
3. Optimize images and other media for performance
4. Add metadata and SEO elements
5. Test across different browsers and devices
6. Consider adding dark mode functionality
