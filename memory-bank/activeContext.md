# Active Context: Deepak Vaid's Portfolio Website

## Current State
The portfolio website is in its initial implementation phase. We have created:

1. A basic HTML structure for the main page with sections for:
   - Professional profile
   - Research focus
   - Publications
   - Teaching and outreach
   - Blog content
   - Code and projects
   - Contact information

2. A comprehensive CSS file for styling, including:
   - Responsive design elements
   - Animation effects
   - Color schemes appropriate for an academic portfolio
   - Typography that enhances readability

3. A simple JavaScript file for interactive elements:
   - Smooth scrolling
   - Animated particles in the hero section
   - Response to scroll events

## Current Focus
The primary focus is on establishing the visual framework and core content of the portfolio, with an emphasis on:

1. Creating a professional yet visually engaging experience
2. Showcasing Deepak's academic credentials and research
3. Highlighting the intersection of quantum physics and programming
4. Ensuring responsive design across all device sizes

## Active Decisions

### Design Philosophy
- Using a clean, academic aesthetic with modern interactive elements
- Color scheme based on blue tones with quantum-inspired accent colors
- Balancing professional credibility with visual interest
- Card-based layout for easy content consumption

### Content Organization
- Hierarchical presentation of content, starting with personal overview
- Segmentation of content into distinct but connected sections
- Strategic use of statistics and metrics to quantify achievements
- Integration of external resources and platforms (GitHub, YouTube, blog)

### Technical Approach
- HTML5 semantic elements for proper structure
- CSS3 for styling with Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity to keep dependencies minimal
- Performance optimization through efficient code

## Next Steps
1. Refine responsive behavior for various screen sizes
2. Implement additional interactive elements for research visualization
3. Optimize images and other media for performance
4. Add metadata and SEO elements
5. Test across different browsers and devices
6. Consider adding dark mode functionality
